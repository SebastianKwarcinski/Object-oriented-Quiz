Object-oriented quiz

This is my final project in college object programming course. It is a typical quiz with typical rules. It has 3 options on the front panel, we can play, add questions and leave the game. I have added point-counting system. About 40 polish languaged questions are inside data base. I hope you enjoy.

In this project I learned how good is object - oriented programing. This kind of programing was created to big projects. When i want to correct an erroer I can find it easier than in the procedural programming.
